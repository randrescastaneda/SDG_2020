It is relatively easy to see that the distribution of Finland is more equalitarian than the one in Costa Rica. we can see several things

- Most people in Costa Rica live below $25 to $30 dollars a day. 
- Finland distribution has a wider bell, whereas Costa Rica's bell is more contracted towards the left side of the distribution
- The typical person in Finland has higher income than the typical person in Costa Rica.

### comparison across countries?
.big[The Gini coefficient is useful for comparing the level of inequality in one economy over time. However, it is insufficient to compare how unequal two economies are. By comparing the Gini coefficient of two different economies, we can say that the population of the one with the higher coefficient faces higher levels of inequality *among inteself* than the population of the other economy, but we cannot say anything about the level of inequality between the two populations. let's see an example]

The median of the distribution, on the other hand, is the middle point in a distribution that has been arranged in order of magnitude. By definition it is unaffected by outliers.

### Relative Vs Absolute inequality

.big[This kind of inequality is known as realtive inequality because it depends on the distribution of welfare within the context in which it is measured. That is, relative inequality does not say anything about the level of welfare between two countries. It only allows us to see if the inequality between the population of one country has icreased or decreased over time, but it does not say anything about how unequal the populations of two different economies are. We need absolute measures of inequality for this endeavor.
