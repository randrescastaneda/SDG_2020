Let's start with an economy in which everybody has the same amount of money, i.e., perfect equality. To make it simple, let's plot the income level of 100 people of this economy, from the poorest to the richest. Since all the people have the same amount of money, The size of the bars have the same legth for everybody.

Yet, the real distribution looks like this.

Under perfect equality, the bottom 20% of the population has 20% of total income. In the real distribution, The bottom 20% of the population has 5% of the distribution and the first 20% of total income is held by the bottom 50%.

### Comparison across countries?
.big[The Gini coefficient is useful for comparing the level of inequality in one economy over time. However, it is insufficient to understand the level inequality **between** two countries. By comparing the Gini coefficient of two different economies, we can say that the population of the one with the higher coefficient faces higher levels of inequality *among itself* than the population of the other economy, but we cannot say anything about the level of inequality between the two populations. ]

The median of the distribution, on the other hand, is the middle point in a distribution that has been arranged in order of magnitude. By definition it is unaffected by outliers. By comparing the medians of two different distribution we can see how better of is the typical person in one country in contrast to the typical person of another country.

One way to do so is by getting the ratio between the medians. In this case, the typical person in Finland is 9.8 times better off than the typical person in South Africa. So, the higher the ratio between the medias the higher the inequality between economies. 

The problem with this approach is that it has to be done country by country. Yet, we can get a lot of information from this approach.

### Relative Vs Absolute inequality

.big[When two points of the distribution are compared proportionally to each other (i.e., how many time one is larger than the other), it is known as relative inequality. In contrast, when the same two points are compared differentially to each other (i.e., the monetary distance between the two), it is known as absolute inequality. Each of these measures is useful for different purposes. Relative inequality aims to measure the level of disproportionality across the distribution, whereas absolute inequality provides a sense of welfare across the distribution. 

When we compare the income distributions of two countries using relative measures of inequality like the Gini coefficient, we are unable to say anything about the difference in welfare between the two populations. When the Gini coefficient of country A is higher than the Gini of country B, we can only say that inequality within A is higher than inequality within B, but we can't say anything about the inequality between A and B.

## Inequality between countries


---
### Inequality between countries
To estimate inequality between countries, we need to make sure that the level of welfare of each country is not affected by its own within inequality. Otherwise, inequality between countries could be confounded by inequality within countries. A simple, yet not perfect, approach to do this is the use a measure of welfare that is not affected by outliers or by unexpected changes in the distribution.
