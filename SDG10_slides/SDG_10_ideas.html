## Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries

???
The objective of this presentation is not show you the flow of the story of goal 10 but my train of thought and the challenges that I have faced looking for a compelling and clear story of welfare inequality at the global level. 

In addition, I will show you only what I have done regarding welfare inequality. I won't discuss today  the other sections of this chapter, mainly everything related to grow of the B40 and non-monetary inequality. I am working that section as well, but that is a little independent of the work that I am showing today.

### In contrast to poverty, inequality measures, Gini in particular, are not additive decomposable. That is, the average of Gini coefs. is not equal to the total Gini.

.big[If I pool the welfare aggregates of all the countries and calculate a global Gini as if it were a single country, what does that tell me?]

- Again, we don't have data for all the countries in all the years, so any two sets of countries in two years will be different to each other.

- Lackner et. al (2019) found no more than 43 countries with which we could calculate an average of the Gini coefsover time, but that set is not representative of the whole world.

LAC is the region that consistently has reduced inequality in most countries. This makes sense because inequality is measured with income-based welfare, which is by definition higher than consumption-based welfare, so there is more room to improve.

### .heatinline[Remarks of this section]

- .big[Even though some poor countries are highly unequal, their inequality is merely arithmetical, not substantial.]

--

- .big[I wonder if reducing inequality in poor countries is a desirable thing]


???
When we say that, in a poor country, the welfare of the rich is 10 times higher than the welfare of the poor, we can't say that the former are 10 times better. At those levels of welfare, inequality becomes, in my view, irrelevant.

Gini might be reflecting just the effect of the top, hiding that the rest of the distribution.

Something that is even more problematic, Gini is not sensible to the tails but to the 25th and 75th percentiles!
